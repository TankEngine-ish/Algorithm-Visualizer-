For my very first project in Python I decided to go for an
algorithm visualizer. 

It was all done in an an Anaconda environment along with Jupyter for the plotting charts inside VSCode.

## Insertion Sort

The first algorithm that was implemented was insertion sort.

## Quick Sort

The second algorithm I implemented was quick sort.
